              We created the application to make sure the process in the medical
              field is faster, more efficient, costs less and can save more
              lives than it already is. This application was created so that as
              many processes as possible could be made easier. It was inspired
              by the rapid inflation of rates in the medical industry and to
              reduce whatever costs possible.
